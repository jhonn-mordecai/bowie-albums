Bowie's paranoid descent into madness yielded this - a brief album, but a bold and stark one that blends his 'plastic soul' sound with the influence of German experimental music, especially on the brilliant title track, which introduces the Thin White Duke persona.

Hours is mostly contemplative, middle-aged acoustic pop with a few hard rock edges, all doused in turn-of-the-century sheen. You could even say it's adult contemporary...

Written and recorded while he was battling the cancer that eventually killed him, it's a bold step back into the Bowie-as-artiste mode that always made his best work so exciting. The epic title track, adventurous approach (jazz musicians were used in lieu of his usual backing band), and vivid imagery and symbolism make it one of the best albums in Bowie's canon and a magnificent and poignant farewell. Had it not been released days before his death, it still would be regarded as one of the best of his career... a rare feet for any classic-rocker, indeed.", "cover":"img/blackstar.jpg", "spot_link":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2w1YJXWMIco6EBf0CovvVN",
